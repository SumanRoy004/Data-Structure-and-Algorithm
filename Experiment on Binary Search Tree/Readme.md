- ## Write an algorithm to insert integers in a binary search tree. Write another algorithm to count the height of a binary search tree. Insert 500 random integers in a binary search tree, calculate the height of such a tree. Repeat the experiment 1000 times. Plot an histogram of the heights obtained. Repeat the above experiment for 1000 integers. Calculate the mean and median height for the above cases. Find h_500/h_1000 see how close the value is to lg500/lg1000 for both the mean and median case.
