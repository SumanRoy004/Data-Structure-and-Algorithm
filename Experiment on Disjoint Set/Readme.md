- ## Implement union find algorithm using linked list,ranked linked list and tree representations on a disjoint set of size n.Perform m operations on each structure,where the first n operations are makeset operations.The rest of the operations are either findset or union chosen at random.Calculate the number of comparisons required to perform the m operations.Plot a graph of no. of comparisons vs m for n=100,m=200,300,500,1000,1200,1500,1800,2000,2400,2800,3000.
